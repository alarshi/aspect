# This is a copy of the grain size strain test. The test imposes simple shear
# across a 100 km square domain with a rheology derived from experiments on
# olivine. The model domain is isobaric and initially isothermal.
# The addinital named output prescribed_field_output_C0 represents the 
# equilibrium grain size, which should be close to 9.35850647e-04 m
# (the value from the grain size strain test).
