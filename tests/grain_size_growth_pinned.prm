# This is a very simple test case that checks
# that the implementation of the grain growth
# laws with pinned grain damage formulation 
# (Mulyukova and Bercovici (2018) are correct. 
# All parameters, including temperature and pressure, are 
# set to constant values and no dynamic recrystallisation 
# is included (the reciprocal required strain is
# set to zero). Material flows in from the left
# and flows out at the right boundary with a constant
# velocity. The grain size
# should then only depend on the x coordinate
# following the relation
#
# d(x) = (d_0 + A * x)^(1/p)
#
# with
# d_0 = 8e-5 m         (initial grain size)
# p   = 10             (grain size exponent)
# A   = 6.668355e-41 1/m^p
#
# leading to a grain size of d=9.74733E-5 m at the
# right boundary of the model. The output after running
# this model gives a grain size of d=9.71484E-5 m.
