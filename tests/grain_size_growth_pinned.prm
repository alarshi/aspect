# This is a very simple test case that checks
# that the implementation of the grain growth
# laws with pinned grain damage formulation
# (Mulyukova and Bercovici (2018) are correct.
# All parameters, including temperature and pressure, are
# set to constant values and no dynamic recrystallisation
# is included (the reciprocal required strain is
# set to zero). Material flows in from the left
# and flows out at the right boundary with a constant
# velocity. The grain size
# should then only depend on the x coordinate
# following the relation
#
# d(x) = (d_0^p + A * x)^(1/p)
#
# with
# d_0 = 8e-5 m                 (initial grain size)
# p   = 10                     (grain size exponent)
# A   = 1.334585e-44 1/m^(p-1) (grain growth rate constant * exp(-E/(RT)) / velocity)
#
# leading to a grain size of d=9.747E-5 m at the
# right boundary of the model.
