# This is a simple test for the equilibrium grain size material model. 
# Most parameters in the viscosity and grain growth laws are set to 1,
# except for the prefactor and strin-rate dependence of dislocation creep.
# The strain rate invariant is set to 1 (dux/dy=2, dux/dy=0, 
# so 1/2*dux/dy+1/2*duy/dx=1).
# This makes it easy to find the equilibrium grain size:
# deqm = sqrt(4*epsilon_dis_II*epsilon_II*eta_effective)
# deqm = sqrt(4*0.5*1*0.5) 
# deqm = 1
