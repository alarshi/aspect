README containing the workflow to take an ASPECT model output and:
	- convert P,T,d,f to Vs, Q
	- write a world.dat file with P,T,d,Vp,Vs,Q,eta specified at each point
	- construct a relevant 1D profile (radial average, sectoral average, or local around raypath)
	- compute travel times, t* and eigenfrequencies
	
Inputs/choices:
a) Geodynamic model result
b) Mineral physics parameterisation
c) frequency

Step-by-step guide

1. Get aspect output file, .csv format. Put in aspect_output folder.

2. Edit MAKE_ALL file, specifying
	- aspect_output file name
	- translation MODEL to be used ('JF10_eBurg' or 'M11')
	- frequency, in Hz, MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY AS A FLOAT
	also make sure all the other inputs in the file are correct, like run#, Ndo, and crust and core and Qk files
	
3. Run ./MAKE_ALL   - this will take a while
	 first, opens matlab and downsamples the aspect output to a much smaller random mesh
	 then, computes a processed ("translated") aspect output file, with all the anelastic velocities calculated. This script also corrects the pressures, by adding the minimum negative pressure to all P values. This script also deletes any points with negative grainsizes.
	 	> this will be named trans_run#_MODEL_freq
	 finally, opens matlab, reads this translated file, and performs the 1D averaging, producing a MINEOS-ready card file, as well as a pdf of the 1D model. 
	 	> these will be named 1D_rundescrip_MODEL_freq.model
	 this is performed by the make_1Dav.m script, which can also be run manually in matlab, to change the options or to make the additional plots that include 2D slices of velocity and grainsize, and a comparison of the raw aspect output model (with anharmonic velocities) with the processed model (with anelastic effects included).
	 
3.5. The above steps should be performed for all the different frequencies that you want to compare. You'll end up with a bunch of .model files, and pdf files showing the V and Q of these 1D models

3.6 Manually, compute the values for 1hz

4. Copy the model files into a folder on povel, and run the following script:



5. You will end up with files in the following directory tree:

	MODEL/
		  freq/
		  	   phase/	
		which contains path_STA# and ttandtstar.txt
