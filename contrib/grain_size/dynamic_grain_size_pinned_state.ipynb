        "This notebook reports on the test results for test `grain_size_strain_pinned.prm` and allows to compare the test against analytical results. The test models a small volume in simple shear flow with constant strain rate, and a grain size that is not at it's equilibrium value. We can compute how much the grain size should change according to the terms given in Eq. 8 of Mulyukova and Bercovici (2018):\n",
